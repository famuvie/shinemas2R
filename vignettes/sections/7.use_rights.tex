\section{Common use rights}

The use of a tool such as a data base rises questions in collaborative research.
The R\'eseau Semences Paysannes is a network that brings together a great diversity of collectives.
Some collectives are known as Community Seed Houses (CSH) \citep{rsp_msp_2014}.

Within RSP, biodiversity is seen as a common.
Therefore, common use rights are needed to manage this common, especilly on data management.

Common use rights related to data management within CSHs can be seen at two levels :

\begin{enumerate}

\item Internal organization rules of the group and their relations with juridic, social, agronomic and economic environments:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Up to which level dematerialze the information ?
	\item Which data to store ?
	\item Which access to data ?
	\end{itemize}

\item Biopiracy risks:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Which data to store ?
	\item Which access to data ?
	\item Link of CSHs with research : which protections of CSHs'work, ressources and knowledge ?
	\end{itemize}

\end{enumerate}
